# Advanced house pricing prediction
Explore and process 6,000 data points and develop a pipeline to clean and transform the data to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices on a large scale, with an acceptable margin of error of around 1,000$ in price predictions, build a Restful API Interface with Web UI to interact with the model, and finally build a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the model to Heroku.
